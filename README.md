## Project Objective
The objective of "From Portland to Portland" is to document a travel by bike through 12 states, starting with New England. You can get a lot of new experiences, donate money to charity and even ask for an autograph from the famous writer Stephen King. The site was created to showcase beautiful places you can visit and share interesting information about them.
